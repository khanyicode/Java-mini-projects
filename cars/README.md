We have a `wethinkcode.cars.v1.Car` class. Write an application that makes *use* of `wethinkcode.cars.v1.Car` instances, changing
their attributes. The main point is that changing attributes on *one* instance does not
affect the state of any *other* instances.

Note that you will need to create a *new* project in your IDE that includes the
source code given for unit-tests; we have *not* created a project for you!
